      "['make sure that the area is a safe place, especially if you plan on walking home at night.  It’s always a good idea to practice the buddy system.  Have a friend meet up and walk with you. Research the bus, train, or streetcar routes available in your area to find safe and affordable travel to your destination.  Make sure you check the schedule for your outgoing and return travel.  Some public transportation will cease to run late at night.  Be sure if you take public transportation to the venue that you will also be able to get home late at night. Check the routes.  Even if some public transit is still running late at night, the routing may change.  Some may run express past many of the stops, or not travel all the way to the ends.  Be sure that your stop will still be available when you need it for your return trip. If you are taking public transit in a vulnerable state after drinking, it is always a good idea to travel in groups.  Having friends available is a good way to stay safe and make sure that you reach your destination. This is more expensive option than a taxi or ride share service, but could be a fun and fancy way to stay safe and ensure that you will have a ride home. Plan this service in advance with a scheduled time to pick you up from your home and the venue.  You want to be sure that the service will still be available when you need to get home. This may be easy in a large city, but taxis may be less frequent in smaller towns.  This is especially true late at night, so this is a less reliable option than scheduling a ride in advance.  Have a friend accompany you and help you flag a cab to make sure you are able to get one. Set up a plan to call a friend when you get home to make sure that you made it safely to your destination. If there are no taxis readily available call a local service to send a car to pick you up. You can share a ride with your friends, or other people using the app at the same moment.  If you are in a vulnerable state it is best to share the ride with your friends to make sure you get home safe. You can request the car to yourself rather than sharing rides with strangers. If you travel home on your own or are the last of your group to be dropped off, make plans to call a friend when you get home so they know you made it safely to your destination. There may be a designated driver service in your area which can chauffeur your group.  Make reservations with them in advance and keep their contact information handy while you are drinking.', \"Designating a driver is a very popular tactic to avoid drinking and driving.  It is important to plan in advance, because your brain function will slow down and your decision making skills will be impaired once you start drinking. Decide before you begin drinking that you will not drive.  Figure out who will be getting you home before you leave. Make sure this person is responsible and keep them in your sight while you are drinking.  Have their contact information handy in case you can’t find them when you are ready to leave.  Choose a friend who doesn’t drink alcohol.  You likely have someone in your friend group who doesn’t drink.  This person is the most likely to remain sober. Decide on one person who will remain sober.  You can take turns within your friend group, alternating who will be the designated driver on each occasion.  Be sure that the designated driver actually remains sober.  The person who has drank the least is still not sober. If you don’t have your car with you, you can guarantee that you won’t make the choice to drive it home. If you are drinking at your home.  Give your keys to a responsible friend to ensure that you don't choose to drive somewhere after you have been drinking. It may be tempting to stay longer or leave with someone else.  Stick to the plan you made in advance and only leave with your sober, designated driver.  Keep the phone number of your driver handy in case you can't find them when you are ready to leave. If your designated driver drinks alcohol, find alternate transportation to get home.\", 'If you have been drinking at all you are at least on the spectrum of drunkenness.  You could be showing signs of impairment and slower brain function including lack of motor skills and slower reaction time, leading to the inability to operate a motor vehicle.  Some of these signs could be:  Poor balance or stumbling.  Difficulty speaking clearly and slurred words.  Abnormal behavior leading to you doing things you wouldn’t normally do if you were sober. As soon as you notice that you are showing signs of impairment, give your keys to a friend, the host or the bartender to ensure that you won’t drive until you are sober.  Make sure to only give them your car key.  Hold onto your house keys. If your friend, the host or the bartender are advising you not to drive, you are likely too drunk.  Listen to their advice and acknowledge that they are trying to help you. Bystander intervention is common when it comes to drinking and driving.  Many people will be willing to step in, take your keys and help you get home safely.  If no one if offering to help, you may need to ask.  Take a ride from a sober friend.  It is best to get in a car with someone you trust when you are in this vulnerable state. Allow the host or bartender to call a cab or car service to take you home. If you are having a difficult time finding a safe way to get home, find a place to stay which does not involve you driving.  Ask the host of the party if there is a place you can sleep.  Give them your keys and ask that they keep them in a safe place until the morning. Stay with a friend if they live nearby and are on their way home. Find a hotel within walking distance.  Call them to book a room, or have a friend help you secure one.  Ask the friend if they will walk you to the hotel and make sure you get checked in safely. There are people in your life who care about you and want to be sure that you are safe.  It may seem scary or embarrassing to call your parents or your siblings if you are too drunk to drive, but they will be glad you did.  Your safety is the most important. You may need your phone to call someone for a ride or get help from a friend.  Be sure to charge your phone before you leave the house.  It is also a good idea to bring a charger with you in case your battery dies before the end of the night or you end up staying where you are and need to get home the next morning. You may also want to invest in a portable battery charger for your phone should there not be a power outlet available.  Make sure it is fully charged before you leave your house.  Keep it handy in your pocket or your bag throughout the night.']\n",

      "   0  . Goals are easiest to achieve when they are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Setting goals that are too vaguely defined or overly ambitious can lead to frustration for you and your child. For example, instead of setting a goal like “Katie will learn to walk,” try something like “Let’s talk to Katie’s physical therapist about trying that 14-week power training program, and see if that improves her mobility.” It’s important that kids with CP feel empowered and involved in their own treatment and development. Talk to your child about what goals they want to achieve for themselves, and work with them and their care team to develop strategies for attaining those goals.  Help your child formulate goals by asking them questions and encouraging them to talk about areas of their life that are important to them (e.g., socializing, sports, or play). For example, you might ask your child, “What’s something new you’d like to try at school this year?” As you work toward your goals together, keep track of how your child is doing. Make note of any major successes or setbacks, and discuss them in meetings with members of your child’s care team. If your child is struggling to meet a particular goal, talk about the possibility of trying a different approach.  Sometimes, it may be necessary to revise your goals or adjust your expectations. Brainstorm with your child’s care team, and discuss new approaches to the problem.  If your child is old enough, involve them in discussions with their care team. They may be able to provide important insights into what works for them and what doesn’t. . Your child may struggle to meet their goals, or it may take them longer to accomplish a particular goal than you anticipated. You and your child may both become frustrated along the way, and that’s ok—it’s perfectly normal. Stop what you are doing and take a break, if you need to. Always praise your child for working toward a goal, even if they don’t have much success at first. Let them know that you are always there for them and want to support them in any way you can. Setbacks and challenges are an inevitable part of working toward any goal. Help your child deal with their feelings of disappointment, frustration and stress by:  Observing your child’s moods and noticing when they are experiencing stress or negative emotions related to difficulty meeting their goals. Encouraging your child to talk about how they are feeling, and recognizing their feelings without judgment.  Listening actively to your child and validating their feelings. You might say something like, “It sounds like you feel really frustrated right now. It’s okay to feel that way. I’m proud of you for trying so hard.” Offering positive touch (such as hugs, high-fives, or pats on the back), when your child wants it. Acknowledging your child’s progress and achievements can help them feel empowered and increase their sense of well-being. Focus your praise on the effort your child is putting in toward achieving a goal, rather than on the end result. This will encourage them to keep working toward their goals and pushing their boundaries. For example, you might say, “Wow, you’re getting better and better at using your crutches! All that work you’ve been putting in is really paying off!” Helping a child with CP can be challenging and stressful. If you find yourself getting overwhelmed, reach out to friends and family for help and support. Ask your child’s doctor to recommend a support group for parents of kids with cerebral palsy. If you are really struggling emotionally, or if you need practical advice on time management and coping skills, consider seeing a therapist.\n",
      "   1  Start the exercise by lying down, extending your legs, and pointing your toes upward to form a straight line with your body. Relax your shoulders and neck and find a comfortable position. Use a yoga mat, a towel, or work on a carpeted or padded floor to make the exercise more comfortable. Interlace or stack your fingers and place them behind your neck to help support your head during the exercise. Your hands should rest comfortably behind your neck and shouldn’t pull on your head.  Don’t round your neck and spine. If you have shoulder flexibility or mobility issues, you can place your fingertips on the sides of your head. Keep your legs together and extend them so they’re straight. You can bend your knees slightly if your flexibility doesn’t allow you to keep them straight, but work to straighten your legs out over time.  Try doing yoga to stretch your hamstrings to improve the flexibility of your legs. You can cross your ankles if it makes it more comfortable for you. Once you’re in a good position with your legs elevated, take a breath and brace your core for the movement by contracting and keeping it tight. Keep your back fully connected to the ground. There should not be any space between your lower back and the ground.\n",

      "   3  Incorporate art-making into playtime. Make an art-zone if you want to isolate the mess. Tape down paper for them to draw on and spill on, and make a smock out of old clothes. Taping paper on a table can help a small child focus on the motion of drawing, without having to hold down and adjust the drawing paper. Buy chunky crayons and washable markers that are easy to grip.  Children will begin their drawing by scribbling. Around 2 years of age, the scribbles will become more controlled and repetitive, and children may begin to grip crayons and markers between their thumb and pointer finger for more control. Offer a variety of art materials at this age. Don't focus only on drawing with tools: children can draw by tracing pictures in the sand, or shaping clay and sticking it on the page. Buy washable paints, nontoxic clay, chalk, child-safe scissors, and many kinds of paper, and store in an easy to access spot. Children develop basic motor skills with every scribble. They also develop creativity, invention, and self-expression. A child this young needs no instructions, only appreciation. Sit with children when they draw, talk with them about their art, but do not attempt to teach. Avoid the impulse to correct. Small children may paint purple grass, floating people, and babies the size of houses. If you correct them you will damage their self-confidence and interrupt their natural learning progress. Rather than praising or correcting a child's art, observe it. Comment on the process, not the product. While the child draws, say \"look at all the circles you are making! Some small circles are inside the big circles\" or \"I see you are using orange and green crayons now.\" Say what you like about a drawing: \"that big sun makes me think of a day at the beach!\" or \"I like how all the trees have different colored leaves.\" Avoid asking \"what is it?\" when presented with a drawing. Instead, ask \"can you tell me about your drawing?\" If a child is excited to talk about their drawing, ask more questions. A child may begin to add more details when you ask questions. When a child is drawing representational work, they will often imagine a story that goes with the work. Asking them to tell you more details of their story will encourage them to draw more details. If you ask \"what does the girl smell,\" for example, they are more likely to add a nose. If you ask \"is the dog lonely at night?\" they may draw more animals. This kind of exchange encourages imagination, story-telling abilities, and drawing skills. If a child is experiencing a strong emotion, offer them paper and markers, or some clay. If a child is having a tantrum, suggest they make an angry picture. If they are sad, a sad one. Art can help children process intense emotions that may be too complex for them to put in words. Giving a child a creative activity over which they have sovereignty can help them gain a sense of control. Around 2 ½ to 3 ½ years of age, children will begin drawing squiggles meant to represent words. These drawings are a child's first steps toward writing. As they grow, the squiggles will become more complex. A child may begin to vary short and long squiggles or draw letter-like shapes mixed up with real letters. These drawings are an exciting sign that a child understands that words can be written to communicate meaning.  Children are likely to tell you that certain squiggles \"mean\" something, or ask you to read them aloud. Affirm the meaning of the squiggles that are read to you, and ask for help reading the others. Let children use the texts they produce. Bring them to the post office to mail their \"letters\" (with an accompanying note) to relatives, Santa, or themselves. Putting children's art up is a way of letting them know their work is interesting and important. Rather than praising every individual drawing, display it. You do not have to put up every piece of art: ask each child what they would like displayed, or create a rotating \"gallery\" that changes weekly or monthly. Keep a portfolio of each child's drawings so they can observe their process. It is more important that a child's practice is affirmed than that their art products are displayed. Displaying final products is no replacement for encouraging the development of their drawing.\n",
      "   4  The diversity in men’s fashion is always expanding, but you can still dress well by building out a wardrobe of staple pieces. Before you go out and buy some staple pieces do some research to see what kind of styles you like. Cut out pages from magazines you like, or download images you find online into a special \"Fashion\" folder.  Gather inspiration from websites. blogs, and magazines that cover men’s fashion. GQ and Esquire are two larger magazines which are focused on men’s fashion and lifestyle. You will not only find ads that feature looks you may like but also get style tips that you can incorporate. Websites like fashionbeans.com, askmen.com, and the subreddit /r/malefashionadvice will give you style tips and keep you updated on current trends. Save some photos of looks that you like to help you get an idea of what kind of basics you want in your wardrobe. Go to clothing stores and try on some clothes. You don’t have to buy something just because you try it on. But seeing how certain clothes and fits look on you will help you to save money and look your best. Dressing well on a college budget might require you to spend more effort finding the right clothes and building out your wardrobe over time. Knowing how much you can spend will help you to make smart buying decisions.   Your clothing budget should come from your extra spending money, not money you need for rent, food, or other bills. If you are committed to dressing well you may have to spend less money eating out and save it for a new shirt. Remember that you don’t need a brand new wardrobe right away. You may find that you already own some nice pieces that you can wear. Don’t think that more expensive clothes are better. While GQ will give you style advice, the clothes which are featured are often more expensive. You can still find similar outfits at other stores for much less. You don’t need a lot of different clothes to make a variety of looks. You can create plenty of looks that get you from class to the gym to the bar with less than 30 pieces of clothing.  Focus on building a versatile wardrobe with items that are compatible with each other. Solid, staple colors and a few essential pieces can be paired with just about anything. Staple clothes include: Jeans and chinos. Collared shirt. T-shirt. Sweater and/or cardigan. Dress shoes and casual shoes. Jacket or blazer. A nice coat if you live somewhere where the weather gets cold. Peacoats are a staple and always in fashion. You can explore other coat styles and should find one you like. But a peacoat is always in style. You want a look you feel comfortable and confident in. You may be more comfortable in a casual look of a sweater, jeans, and casual shoes. Or, you may like to dress up more and wear button-downs and chinos. Regardless of your preferred look, get clothes that fit your body well.  Everyone’s body is different and certain patterns, cuts, and even certain brands of clothing will work in your favor. Generally, thinner vertical lines will slim you down, while thicker horizontal lines make you look broader. Patterns typically shorten a part of your body. Slimmer cuts in shirts and pants will accentuate the shape of your body. In addition to getting stylish clothes you need clothes that fit well and make your body look proportional. Men with broader shoulders and a smaller waist will be able to wear most fits whether you like a slim cut or a looser one. If you have a bit of a wider midsection, opt for tops that have vertical stripes or are a solid color. Get pants with a slimmer straight leg to make your legs look longer and create an even line from your waist. Add layers to accentuate certain areas. If you have narrower shoulders you can throw on a jacket or a crew neck sweater to give yourself a broader look and more definition. Invest in a trusty pair of dark denim jeans. Denim is one of the most versatile pieces of clothing you own.\n",
      "   5  If you or someone you are thinking about suicide, get help immediately. Call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or your local emergency response (911). The following are some signs to look for if you are concerned about a loved one:  Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves. Looking for a way to kill themselves. Making statements about being hopeless. Talking about having no reason to live. A psychologist or counselor can help you understand difficult emotions and overcome trauma. This person has the education, training, and experience to help you overcome issues that are driving your behaviors.  Ask your doctor for a referral to a counselor or psychologist who specializes in self-harm. Schedule an appointment to talk. If you have trouble being honest with a close friend or family member, you may find it freeing and comforting to share with someone who doesn't know you. If you have some really difficult life situations, such as abuse or a traumatic incident, or your feelings are so overwhelming that they drive you to cut or harm yourself, the most productive place for you to express those feelings is in a safe, neutral, and nonjudgmental environment. Your community may have a self-injury support group. This group can be helpful in identifying, verbalizing and coping with feelings associated with self-harm. Look on the S.A.F.E. Alternatives website for listings of support groups near you. Some people who self-harm may be experiencing other mental health issues, such as depression,, substance abuse, eating disorders, schizophrenia, or personality disorders., If you feel that you may have another disorder that is contributing to your self-harm, talk with your doctor or counselor. Be truthful with your therapist about what you feel or what's been going on. Remember that he is there to help you. If you aren't honest, you might not get the treatment you really need. It's important to tell the truth. Remember, therapy is confidential, so anything you say to your therapist will not be repeated unless you are planning to hurt yourself or another.\n",
      "   6  Once the dill plants are mature, you can harvest the herb at any time. Or, check the calendar (assuming that you marked down when you planted the seeds). Dill will be mature about 8 weeks after the seeds were planted. Use a pair of sharp household scissors to cut the leafy, edible part off of the stem. The edible part of the dill plant is the feathery, light leaves. You can harvest as much of the dill at once as you like, since taking a large harvest won’t damage the plant. Once the leaves are harvested, use the scissors to cut the dill leaves up as finely as you like.  If you don’t have sharp scissors, you can use your thumb and index finger to pinch the leafy parts of the dill off of the stems. While dill seeds are edible, they’re used for different culinary purposes than the leaves. Unlike many other herbs, fresh dill and dried dill have markedly different tastes. If you prefer the taste of fresh dill, only harvest as much as you’ll eat over the span of a few days. If you plan to store some dill, keep it in an airtight container like a plastic bag. This will maintain the herb’s fresh flavor. Fresh dill will keep for a period of 2 weeks. Dried dill is also commonly stored in a small glass jar and kept in the household spice drawer or spice rack.\n",
      "   7  Sometimes called \"higher\" and \"lower\" concerns, it's important to prioritize major issues like content, creative thinking, and organization over more minor issues like grammar, usage, and spelling. These designations obviously depend upon many things, like the assignment, the grade-level of your students, and their individual concerns. If you're in the middle of a unit on comma usage, it's perfectly fine to call that a \"higher\" concern. But in general, a basic writing assignment should prioritize the higher concerns listed above. When you've got a stack of 50 or 100 papers to go through and another stack of quizzes to finish and lessons to plan it can be tempting to jump right in and start slapping Bs on everything. Resist that temptation. Read through each essay individually before marking anything. Look for the highest order of concerns first:  Does the student address the prompt and fulfill the assignment effectively? Does the student think creatively? Does the student clearly state their argument, or thesis? Is the thesis developed over the course of the assignment? Does the writer provide evidence? Does the paper show evidence of organization and revision, or does it seem like a first draft? Getting an assignment back that looks like someone bled all over it can be a source of great anxiety in the life of a student. Some teachers argue that red asserts authority. While that may be true, there are other ways to assert your authority than pen color. Marking essays in pencil can suggest that the issues are easily fixable, keeping the student looking forward, rather than dwelling on their success or failure. Pencil, blue, or black pen is perfectly appropriate. Write comments, criticisms, and questions in the margins as neatly as possible. Find moments that the writer needs to clarify and circle them or underline them. Be as specific as possible when asking questions. \"What?\" is not a particularly helpful question to scrawl in the margin, compared to \"What do you mean by 'some societies'?\" When you've addressed the most important issues of the essay, its content, feel free to mark some lower-order concerns, like usage, grammar, and punctuation. Depending on the grade-level of the essays and the skill-level of your students, these may be more or less important. Typical proofreading marks include the following:  ¶ = to start a new paragraph three underscores under a letter = to lowercase or uppercase the letter \"sp\" = word is spelled incorrectly word crossed out with a small \"pigtail\" above = word needs to be deleted Some teachers use the first page as a rule of thumb for marking later concerns. If there are sentence-level issues, mark them on the first page and then stop marking them throughout the essay, especially if the assignment needs more revision.\n",
      "   8  These motions cause the tube between the middle ear and the nose and throat (the Eustachian tube) to open up. Doing this can relieve the pressure in your ears, but you may have to try several times. Both of these actions encourage more swallowing, helping to relieve the pressure. Chewing gum or sucking on candy is a great idea if you need to relieve pressure over a period of time. For instance, try chewing gum when descending in a plane, or sucking on candy if you’ve got a cold. If you still feel pressure after landing in a plane, keep chewing gum or sucking on candy. This will help your ears return to normal pressure more quickly. Babies probably don’t know how to swallow or yawn at will, and they can’t safely be given gum or hard candy. Instead, feed them from a bottle or give them a pacifier. This will encourage sucking, and help relieve ear pressure. Make sure to give a baby a bottle or pacifier when taking off or landing in a plane, or any other time you expect changes in air pressure.\n",
      "   9  A calorie is a unit of energy, and can come from a variety of different sources. How many calories you consume in a day determines how much energy you provide for your body. If you consume too many calories on a daily basis, you can gain weight as the energy is converted to fat. If you eat fewer calories than your body needs, you can burn fat and lose weight.  Ingredients that are calorie-dense, like butter, oil, or sugar, tend to be bad for you. Foods that tend to have a low caloric content are usually good for you, like avocado, celery, or corn. Empty calories refer to calories that are low in nutritional value, like pizza, soda, or sausage. The next row on the label is fat, and it is accompanied by 2 different types of fat underneath the total number content. Fat helps provide cell development and stores energy in the body. It is found in a lot of plants and animals, and isn't necessarily bad for you if you don't have too much of it.  Saturated fat refers to fats that come from animals. They are worse for your body than unsaturated fats. Trans fats are a kind of unsaturated fat found in oils. They are especially bad for you, and you should avoid foods with a lot of trans fat in them at all costs. Cholesterol is a fat-like material that occurs naturally in your body. You need some forms of cholesterol to regulate hormones, but too much cholesterol can increase your risk for heart disease. Avoid foods with high cholesterol values whenever you can to keep your heart happy and healthy.  There are 3 main types of cholesterol: HDL, LDL, and VLDL. They refer to the density of the cholesterol. Your body needs some HDL to keep your liver healthy, but LDL and VLDL should be avoided. Red meats and junk foods tend to be high in cholesterol. Under cholesterol, you can find the sodium content in a single serving. Sodium is found in salt, and your body needs less than 500 milligrams a day. Too much sodium can cause your blood pressure to rise, which can increase your risk of stroke, heart failure, osteoporosis, and cancer. Stay away from foods that are high in sodium whenever you can.  If you're trying to cut down on sodium, consider cutting soda and junk food out of your diet completely. Try to consume less than 20% of your daily value in sodium every day. Carbohydrates are nutrients that produce calories. They generate fuel for the nervous system and muscles, and help your body metabolize fats. Carbohydrates can be bad for you if they come from a source that is high in fat, sodium, or cholesterol (such as some pasta dishes, pizza, or dairy products).  Eating too many carbohydrates can put you at risk of weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Not eating enough carbohydrates can result in hypoglycemia or energy loss. Fiber is a nutrient found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Fiber helps your digestive tract and aids in the burning of fat. Eating fiber is a good way to promote a healthy diet, and foods that tend to be high in fiber are usually very good for you. Aim to consume at least 20-30 grams of fiber every day.  Fiber can also counteract high cholesterol levels if you consume enough of it on a daily basis. There are fiber supplements that you can take to artificially raise your fiber intake every day. There are 2 types of sugar, natural and added sugar. Natural sugars are found in fruit and dairy products and aren't bad for you in small amounts. Added sugars are harder for your body to digest, and should be avoided whenever possible. Natural sugars usually come in foods that are high in fiber or protein, while added sugars are can lead to weight gain, heart problems, or type 2 diabetes. Added sugars are only listed on some food labels. To make sure that there are no added sugars, look for the phrase “sugar free” printed on a container or check for corn sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, or sugar in the ingredients list. Protein is a nutrient that promotes muscle growth and health. It is often found in meat, but also appears naturally in nuts, legumes, and eggs. Protein also helps the immune system and aids your body's metabolism. Don't focus exclusively on a food's protein content though, since a lot of high-protein foods often come alongside high fat, sodium, or cholesterol contents.  Try to get protein in foods that are also low in carbohydrates or calories. Seafood, vegetables, and lean meats are all excellent sources of protein. You can increase your daily protein intake by mixing protein powder into shakes if you want to get enough protein without increasing the amount that you're eating every day. Under the protein or fiber, you'll see a black bar separating another set of ingredients. These are vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that are found in the food. The most common inclusions are vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. These nutrients are good for you, and if the list under this black bar is longer, then the food is probably healthy for you.  Vitamin A helps promote vision and keeps your immune and reproductive systems operating at a healthy level. It also helps your lungs, kidneys, and other organs functioning normally.  Vitamin C helps repair body tissue and promotes healthy skin.  Calcium keeps your bones healthy and strong. It also helps blood clot and makes it easier for muscles to contract. Calcium consumption is important when you're young.  Iron transports oxygen in your blood and helps to convert nutrients into energy. If you're iron deficient, you could become anemic.\n",
      "  10  In order for biodegradable items to break down quickly, they need to be in contact with moisture. The easiest way to do this is to sprinkle each layer lightly with water as you build the heap. Add water or wet, green materials if the pile seems dry. However, add dry, brown materials if the pile seems too wet.  In dry weather, fill your compost bucket with water each time you dump it in the compost pile. This will help add needed moisture. Your pile should be about as damp as a sponge that has been wrung out. In order to help compost break-down faster, shred leaves and other yard debris and crush egg shells. Since it takes longer for larger pieces to break down, this will speed up the time it takes to make compost. You want the compost pile to be warm so that microbes will thrive and break down the organic material you have collected. Covering the compost with a black garden cloth or other black covering during cold weather will help raise the temperature.  The temperature of the compost pile is very important and is an indication of the microbial activity of the decomposition process. The simplest way to track the temperature inside the heap is by feeling it with your hand. If it is warm or hot, everything is decomposing as it should. If it is the same temperature as the surrounding air, the microbial activity has slowed down and you need to add more materials that are high in nitrogen (green materials) to the bin. Covering the top of the container will also make the compost pile look neater. Move matter from inside to outside and from top to bottom. Break up anything that is clumpy or matted. If you are still adding to the pile, take the opportunity while you turn it to introduce the new matter and mix it well with the older matter.  You can turn the pile by using a pitchfork and moving the entire pile to the clear spot. Mix it up and then move it back into the bin. Mixing the pile in this way helps to keep air flowing inside the pile, which encourages decomposition. You can also get a tool that is specifically made for mixing compost. This compost mixer is a pole with a handle on 1 end and mixing tines on the other. You simply shove the tines down into the compost pile and then twist the handle to mix. It's a good idea to mix your compost on a regular basis, especially if you are adding kitchen scraps that could become smelly if not mixed in. Turning the pile helps to encourage the growth of the right kind of bacteria and makes for a nice, sweet-smelling pile that will decompose faster. At some point, you may need to stop adding to the compost pile to let it \"finish up.\" You will know your compost is ready for use when it is no longer warm and it is a deep brown color throughout.  It usually takes about 2 to 3 months for compost to be made, depending on the weather conditions and the contents of your pile. Very fresh compost can grow plants, but it can also rob the soil of nitrogen as it continues to break down. If you think your compost is not all the way done, either leave the compost in the bin for a while longer or spread it in your garden and let it sit there for a few weeks before planting anything in it. your compost. If all goes well, you will eventually find that you have a layer of good compost at the bottom of your bin. Remove this and spread it on or dig it into your garden beds.  You may wish to sift it through a coarse mesh screen or use your hands or pitchfork to remove any larger chunks that haven't yet broken down. Composting works almost magically and fast. If you begin with a cubic yard of proper materials, keep it moist, and turn it weekly, it's possible to get several large batches of compost each year.\n"
